### Unity 

The last game I made has been published on the android store. It's called Space! Math by Creative Crashes. [The store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creativeCrashes.Space_Math)

Survival shooter is only compatible with Unity 5 (5.4), but I have a gameplay video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXktk_7ww3g). I worked on this about two years ago.

I also worked on Wizard Kitty with Clouby during my last year of college, we put together this demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzC-zG9agOY).

otherStuff contains small examples of editor scripting, debug funtions, Utility functions, and scriptable object workflow. All of which I am utilizing in my new game!
