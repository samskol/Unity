### Unity 

Survival shooter is only compatible with Unity 5 (5.4), but I have a gameplay video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXktk_7ww3g).
I also worked on Wizard Kitty with Clouby during college, we put together this demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzC-zG9agOY).

otherStuff contains small examples of editor scripting, debug funtions, Utility functions, and scriptable object workflow.
